              "copy": "<p>Hi, I’m Rosie (sometimes known as Sweetapolita), and you are not in Kansas anymore! You have officially landed in the colourful, magical land of sprinkles: SWEETAPOLITA | Where Happy Lives. Welcome! <br\/><br\/>A bit more about my story, and how the heck Sweetapolita came to be: When I was sixteen, as a result of pure serendipity, I got a job at the only fancy bakery in our city, and it was during that time that I (officially) fell in love with the world-and-wonder of cake and confection. Despite having a long-time enchantment with pretty baked goods, my “cake” career began in a much different way when, in 2000, I partnered with a friend and created a successful dessert-themed bath and body product company called Cake Beauty in my kitchen. And although I left the thriving company in 2003, I believe that those were the formative years of what later became Sweetapolita. Several years later in 2009, after having my first little cakelet, Reese, I dove deep into professional baking and cake courses and was lucky enough to learn from some of the world’s leading cake artists and ultimately became a professional baker and cake designer myself. After weeks of feverish brainstorming, I came up with the name Sweetapolita—a nonsensical word that would represent my playful approach to baking (and life), and hopefully capture the essence of what I create and release into the universe. <br\/><br\/>Armed with a whimsical name and a burning desire, I started a baking blog in 2010--my creative heart and soul were all a-sparkle. After several years of living all-things-baking, I wrote The Sweetapolita Bakebook, and it was during this time that I felt particularly connected to the world of sprinkles. I knew there was a way to elevate and celebrate sprinkles in a way that would bring ease and excitement to not only every baker, but to anyone who wanted to play in the kitchen. It was a magnetic pull I could not ignore; perhaps it is the instant yay they inject into anything they land upon, launching inspiration to create colorful sweets and sparking much childhood joy for everyone involved. I couldn’t explain why my connection to these crunchy little bits was so strong, but the creative in me knew this was where I was meant to be, and the entrepreneur in me felt reinvigorated. In June 2015, I created a small collection of Sprinkle Medleys—mixes of premium sprinkles that celebrate color and texture with enough wow to be the star of any show—and started an Etsy shop. Fast forward to today, and Sweetapolita has evolved into a global lifestyle brand, providing more happiness than I could have ever imagined possible. I believe we need to create our dream job, if it doesn’t already exist. <br\/><br\/>Whether it’s blogging, opening a bakeshop, starting an empire, or even simply being the noted baker of the family, I believe you can thrive if you set out to be different and memorable. Let’s do what we love, kick it up a notch, and bake the world happy!<br\/><br\/>Love, Rosie xo <\/p>",

As the original artisan sprinkle company, blazing a sprinkly trail is our mission, but there is so much more to our products than innovative colours and shapes. We work exclusively with gold-standard confectionery manufacturers in Canada, United States and Europe, creating custom sprinkles that make our hearts sing, and then we design, create and package all of our Sprinkle Medleys in house with love and care by The Sprinkle Squad.<br\/><br\/>Our standard for premium components in this industry is very rare, as inexpensive, lesser quality, look-a-like alternatives are readily available from other parts of the world, as commonly found among our competitors’ products. One of the several key distinctions between Sweetapolita and the many companies who now follow our lead, and mimic our work, is quality. Simply put, we insist on the best and only the best in every single bottle we create.<br\/><br\/>We stand by our mission to continue to innovate, never, ever, imitate. It is our sprinkly promise to you to continue to dream, create and offer unique products that are born out of inspiration and dedication to all things colourful and sweet. <\/p>",
